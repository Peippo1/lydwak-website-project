            This page is a dedication to the truly excellent Lydia Wakelam. The queen behind the camera and a true
            artist who has helped to capture and create the story of manchester in recent times and is someone I am
            truly proud to call my friend. </p>

        <p>
            You have probably never seen her face but she has worked with some of the most innovative and exciting
            venues, restaurants and people that this fine city has to offer.
            Her artwork has touched everything from community projects to major events and helps tell the story of the
            city through her eyes.
            <!--paragraph2-->

            So hereâ€™s to you Lydia, the stories you tell and the people that you love.
